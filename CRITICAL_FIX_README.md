# 🚨 CRITICAL: Render Backend Needs Manual Deployment

## The drawings aren’t appearing because the backend endpoints aren’t deployed yet

### Immediate Action Required:

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Find your backend service** (named `r4s` or similar)
3. **Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"**
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment

### Why This is Happening:
- All code is committed and pushed to GitHub ✅
- Backend on Render is still running OLD code ❌
- New inspection endpoints don't exist on deployed version ❌

### What Will Work After Deploy:
- ✅ `/api/v1/inspections/:id` - View specific inspection
- ✅ `/api/v1/inspections/:id/workorders` - Get work orders for inspection
- ✅ Images with crack annotations will display
- ✅ Work orders will show up

### Test After Deploy:
Once deployed, refresh your browser and try:
1. Upload an image
2. Click "View Details" 
3. Images should load with crack markings

### Alternative if Render is Taking Too Long:
Run backend locally:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```

Then visit: http://localhost:3000

**DO THIS NOW**: Go to Render and click "Manual Deploy"!
