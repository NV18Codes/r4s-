- Show the upload interface
- Explain the two main actions:
  - "Upload Road Image" - New crack detection feature
  - "Add Inspection" - Traditional inspection workflow

**Highlight:**
- "This is where the AI-powered crack detection happens."

---

### 4. Upload Road Image (2 minutes)

**Say:** "Let me upload a road image and show you the automatic crack detection."

**Demonstrate:**
1. Click "Upload Road Image" button
2. Upload interface appears
3. Click "Choose File" and select a road image
4. Show the filename appears
5. Click "Upload & Analyze"

**What Happens:**
- File uploads to backend
- Image is processed
- Crack detection algorithm runs
- Results are displayed

**Watch in DevTools:**
- Show the POST request to `/images` endpoint
- Show the response with crack detection results

---

### 5. Show Detection Results (2 minutes)

**Say:** "The system has analyzed the image and detected cracks."

**Demonstrate:**
- Show status: "completed" ‚úÖ
- Show crack count: "Found X cracks"
- Show confidence score
- Success notification appears

**Explain:**
- "The algorithm has analyzed the entire image"
- "Each crack is detected with bounding boxes"
- "The system assigns a confidence score to each detection"

**Highlight:**
- "All of this happens in under 2-3 seconds!"

---

### 6. API Verification (1 minute)

**Say:** "Let me show you the technical implementation working."

**Open DevTools ‚Üí Network Tab:**
1. Show the request to `/images` endpoint
2. Show response with crack data
3. Show status 200 (success)
4. Show response time

**Explain:**
- "The frontend makes a clean API call to our backend"
- "The serverless function processes the image"
- "Results are returned in a structured format"

---

### 7. Upload Another Image (2 minutes)

**Say:** "Let me show another example with a different image."

**Demonstrate:**
1. Upload second image
2. Show different detection results
3. Highlight the variance in crack counts
4. Show different confidence scores

**Explain:**
- "Each image is analyzed individually"
- "Results vary based on actual crack presence"
- "The algorithm is consistent in its analysis"

---

### 8. Work Order Creation (1 minute)

**Say:** "When cracks are detected, work orders are automatically created."

**Demonstrate:**
- Navigate to Work Orders page
- Show automatically created work orders
- Explain priority levels:
  - "High priority for 5+ cracks"
  - "Normal priority for fewer cracks"

**Highlight:**
- "No manual intervention needed"
- "Work orders include all relevant details"

---

### 9. Real-Time Updates (1 minute)

**Say:** "Let me show how the system updates in real-time."

**Demonstrate:**
- Upload another image
- Show status goes from "pending" ‚Üí "processing" ‚Üí "completed"
- Show how UI updates automatically
- Show toast notifications

**Explain:**
- "The frontend polls for status updates"
- "Users see progress in real-time"
- "No page refresh needed"

---
