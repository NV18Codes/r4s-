## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Quick Deploy:

```bash
# 1. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add complete crack detection with Netlify deployment"

# 2. Push to Git
git push origin crack-detection

# 3. Deploy to Netlify
# Option A: Via Git integration (automatically deploys on push)
# Option B: Via CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Deploy Options:

**Option 1: Git Integration (Recommended)**
1. Push to GitHub/GitLab repository
2. Connect to Netlify
3. Netlify auto-deploys on every push

**Option 2: Netlify CLI**
1. `npm install -g netlify-cli`
2. `netlify login`
3. `netlify deploy --prod`

**Option 3: Drag & Drop**
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Drag `.next` folder to Netlify dashboard

---

## 🧪 Testing the Deployment

### Local Testing:

```bash
# 1. Start local backend (optional)
cd roadsintel-backend
npm install
npm run start:dev

# 2. Start frontend
cd ..
npm run dev

# 3. Test at http://localhost:3000/dashboard/inspections
```

### Production Testing:

1. Visit your Netlify URL
2. Go to Inspections page
3. Upload an image
4. Verify detection results
5. Check work orders created

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### Architecture:

```
Frontend (Next.js)
    ↓
Environment Detection
    ↓
Local Backend (NestJS)    OR    Netlify Functions
    ↓                                ↓
MySQL Database              In-Memory Storage
```

### API Flow:

1. **Upload Image:**
   - Frontend sends image to API
   - Backend/Function receives image
   - Detection algorithm processes
   - Results stored

2. **Get Status:**
   - Frontend polls for status
   - Backend/Function returns status
   - UI updates in real-time

3. **Work Orders:**
   - Automatically created when cracks detected
   - Priority based on crack count
   - Visible in dashboard
