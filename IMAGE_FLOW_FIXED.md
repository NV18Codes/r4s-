# ✅ Image Upload & Crack Detection Flow - FIXED

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **API Endpoints Corrected**
- ✅ Inspections list: Changed from `/api/inspections` to `/api/v1/inspections`
- ✅ Inspection details: Changed from `/api/inspections/:id` to `/api/v1/inspections/:id`
- ✅ Work orders: Changed from `/api/workorder` to `/api/v1/workorders`
- ✅ Inspection work orders: Changed to `/api/v1/inspections/:id/workorders`

### 2. **Inspection Details Page**
- ✅ Fixed loading state management
- ✅ Added proper error handling
- ✅ Added toast notifications
- ✅ Fixed API response parsing

### 3. **Image Viewer Component**
- ✅ Shows original image
- ✅ Shows annotated image with crack markings
- ✅ Displays bounding boxes around cracks
- ✅ Shows crack points
- ✅ Displays crack numbers
- ✅ Color coded by severity (High=Red, Medium=Orange, Low=Yellow)

### 4. **Work Orders Flow**
- ✅ Automatically created when `crackCount > 0`
- ✅ Shows in inspection details page
- ✅ Shows in work orders page
- ✅ Links inspection to work order

## Complete Flow

### 1. **Upload Image** (Inspections Page)
```
User clicks "Upload Road Image" → Selects image → Clicks "Upload & Analyze"
↓
Frontend sends image to /api/v1/images/upload
↓
Backend processes image:
  - Uploads to Supabase Storage
  - Runs AI crack detection
  - Creates inspection record
  - Creates work order (if cracks found)
↓
Response includes:
  - originalImageUrl
  - annotatedImageUrl
  - cracks (array with coordinates)
  - crackCount
  - severity
  - inspection object
  - workOrder object (if created)
```

### 2. **View Inspection List**
```
Inspections page fetches from /api/v1/inspections
↓
Displays:
  - Image thumbnail
  - Inspection ID
  - Crack count with severity badge
  - Status
  - Inspector name
  - Date
  - "View Details" link
```

### 3. **View Inspection Details**
```
Click "View Details" → Opens /dashboard/inspections/[id]
↓
Fetches inspection from /api/v1/inspections/[id]
↓
Fetches work orders from /api/v1/inspections/[id]/workorders
↓
Displays:
  - Image viewer with annotations
  - Crack analysis details
  - Inspection information
  - Related work orders
```

### 4. **View Work Orders**
```
Work Orders page fetches from /api/v1/workorders
↓
Displays all work orders created from inspections
```

## API Endpoints Used

### Backend (Node.js + Supabase)
```javascript
POST   /api/v1/images/upload           // Upload image + detect cracks
GET    /api/v1/inspections              // Get all inspections
GET    /api/v1/inspections/:id          // Get specific inspection
GET    /api/v1/inspections/:id/workorders // Get work orders for inspection
GET    /api/v1/workorders                // Get all work orders
```

## Image Structure

### Original Image
- Uploaded to Supabase Storage in `road-images` bucket
- Gets public URL for display

### Annotated Image
- Same as original (for now)
- Crack markings drawn client-side using coordinates
- Each crack has:
  - Bounding box (x, y, width, height)
  - Points array (coordinates for crack path)
  - Confidence score
  - Type (linear or branching)

## Crack Detection Response

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "status": "Success",
    "messages": [{ "text": "Image processed successfully" }]
  },

      "title": "Repair 3 crack(s) - Medium Priority",
      "status": "Open",
      "priority": "Medium"
    },
    "cracks": [...],
    "crackCount": 3,
    "severity": "Medium",
    "originalImageUrl": "https://...",
    "annotatedImageUrl": "https://...",
    "message": "AI Detection complete! Found 3 crack(s) with Medium severity."
  }
}
```

## Visual Markings

### Bounding Box
- Rectangle around each detected crack
- Color: Red (High), Orange (Medium), Yellow (Low)
- Border width: 3px

### Crack Points Loaf
- Small circles along the crack path
- Same color as bounding box
- Size: 4x4px

### Crack Number
- Label at top-left of bounding box
- Shows crack ID (1, 2, 3, ...)
- Background: severity color
- Text: white

## Testing

1. ✅ Upload an image from Inspections page
2. ✅ View image with annotations immediately after upload
3. ✅ Click "View Details" to see full inspection
4. ✅ Verify work order created (if cracks found)
5. ✅ Check Work Orders page for new work order

## Status

✅ **All issues fixed - Ready for demo!**
