```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "filename": "road.jpg",
  "status": "completed",
  "crackCount": 3,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "boxes": [
    {
      "x1": 100,
      "y1": 150,
      "x2": 250,
      "y2": 200,
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "class": "crack"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Returns status 200

## 🎯 Current Implementation Details

### Crack Detection Algorithm (Simulation)

Currently uses random detection for demonstration:

```javascript
function detectCracks() {
  const crackCount = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
  // Generate random bounding boxes
  return { boxes, crackCount, confidence };
}
```

**Production Enhancement Needed:**
- Integrate real YOLOv8 model
- Train on crack detection dataset
- Improve accuracy and confidence

### Image Annotation

Implemented with HTML5 Canvas:

```javascript
ctx.strokeRect(x, y, width, height); // Draw red box
ctx.fillText(label, x + 5, y - 5);   // Draw label
```

### Data Flow

```
User Upload
    ↓
Base64 Encoding
    ↓
POST to Serverless Function
    ↓
Simulate Crack Detection
    ↓
Return Detection Data
    ↓
Frontend Draws Bounding Boxes
    ↓
Display Results
```

npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node
# or
pip install ultralytics
```

### 2. Database Storage

Replace in-memory storage with database:
- Use Upstash Redis for Netlify
- Or PostgreSQL/MySQL for full backend
- Store images and detection results

### 3. Additional Features

- [ ] Inspection listing (GET endpoint)
- [ ] Inspection history view
- [ ] Edit/delete inspections
- [ ] Severity classification
- [ ] Batch upload
- [ ] Export reports

## 📞 Testing Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Netlify functions are deployed
3. Test with different images
4. Check network tab for API calls

**All tests are passing in the current implementation!** ✅

The system is ready for demonstration and further enhancement.
