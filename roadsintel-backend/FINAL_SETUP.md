# Final Setup Steps - Get Crack Detection Working!

## ✅ What's Done

1. ✅ `.env` file created with database credentials
2. ✅ Dependencies installed (392 packages)
3. ✅ Prisma client generated
4. ✅ Database `roadsintel` created
5. ✅ All tables created (RoadImage, CrackDetection, WorkOrder)

## ⏳ What's Left

1. ⏳ Start Redis (required for job queue)
2. ⏳ Start backend server
3. ⏳ Test crack detection

## 🚀 Choose Your Path

### Path A: Install Redis via WSL2 (Recommended - 10 mins)

**Step 1:** Install WSL2
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
wsl --install
```
Restart computer when prompted.

**Step 2:** After restart, install Redis in WSL
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server -y
sudo service redis-server start
```

**Step 3:** Verify Redis
```bash
redis-cli ping
# Should return: PONG
```

**Step 4:** Keep WSL open, exit to Windows
```bash
exit
```

**Step 5:** Start backend
```powershell
cd roadsintel-backend
npm run start:dev
```

✅ Done! Backend should start on port 3001.

### Path B: Test Without Redis (Simpler, 2 mins)

Let me know and I'll create a version that works without Redis for immediate testing.

## 🧪 After Backend Starts

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/inspections
2. Click "Upload Road Image"
3. Select an image
4. Click "Upload & Analyze"
5. See crack detection results! 🎉
